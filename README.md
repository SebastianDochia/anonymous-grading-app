*Objective:* Developing a web application which allows student projects to be graded by anonymous juries of colleagues.


## Description
The application allows students projects to be graded by anonymous juries of peers.
The application is built on a Single Page Application architecture and is accessible from the browser on the desktop, mobile devices or tablets (depending on user preference).

## Functionality 
- Student member in a project team (PM) can add a project and define a series of partial project deliverables. By registering, the studen automatically becomes eligible as an evaluator.
- PM can add a demonstrative video or a link to a server hosting the deployed project for any partial deliverable.
- When a partial deliverable is due, any student who is not a PM for a particular project can be randomly selected to be part of the project jury. A student which is a member of said jury can grade the project. 
- The grade for the project is anonymous and the total grade is calculated by omitting the lowest and highest grades and then averaging the remaining ones. The grades are 1-10 with at most 2 fractional digits.
- The professor can see the results of the evaluation for each project, without being able to see the identity of the jury members.
- The application has a system of permissions. Only a member of the jury can add/modify grades and they can only modify their own grades. Grades can only be modified for a limited period of time.
 


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
